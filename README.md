# Music Sorting

A simple script I found on github and decided to refactor to fit my needs, it works like this:
- It searches every folder in the current directory.
- Puts all the files inside a temporary "tempunsorted" folder
- Sorts all the music files into their respective Artists folders.
- Renames all the files to their respective songs names.

I am NOT saying this is better than the repo I forked, this is simply a different use-case I decided to adapt.

### Why?

I usually have a large folder on my system containing all the songs I listen, and cmus is my player so there is no problem with a large folder like that. **But** I bought a car with an usb playing thing and on there that approach is not at all viable, it needs to be sorted into folders for it to be usable, and so I thought "Huh I'm going to write a python script for that, but let me check github first" and then I found this awesome project by [@Tclack88](https://github.com/tclack88) that he made years ago to sort his iPod songs, and so I just needed to change a few things here and there.

If you end up using this project, it is mostly thanks to him, give him a follow and a star on the original repo!
